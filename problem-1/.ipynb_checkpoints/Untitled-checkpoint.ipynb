    "## Faces\n",
    "A face needs support when its is \"flat\" i.e. its normal vectors is close to the gravity vector. A cross product to get the normal vector, followed by a dot product with the gravity vector, makes computing that really easy.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Edges\n",
    "In addition to edges surrounding faces needing support, some edges themselves need to be supported, even if both of their neighboring faces are fine. An example is a horizontal edge connecting two faces in a \"V\" configuration. Notice that this edge requires support, while the inverse case (a peak) doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are looking for an edge that is mostly horizontal (dot product again), and where neither (none) of its neighboring faces is sufficiently below it to support it (using their normals).
